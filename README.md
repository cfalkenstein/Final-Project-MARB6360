# Final-Project-MARB6360
# This project will be assorting Texas Park and Wildlife (TPWD) survey datasets using gill nets as catching mechanisms in Corpus Christi and Aransas bays. The dataset began in 1972 and continues up until 2024. The coding skills used in this class will reveal the CPUE of bull sharks by sorting and tidying the dataset to determine frequency of locations where bull sharks have been caught in that 52 year period.
